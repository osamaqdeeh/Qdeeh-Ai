DEBUG FIXES SUMMARY - 2026-02-11 14:40:57
========================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
-----------------
Error: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props.
This error occurred because Radix UI components that require interactivity 
were missing the "use client" directive in Next.js 15.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
In Next.js 15 with React Server Components, any component that uses:
- Event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)
- React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Browser APIs
- Interactive Radix UI primitives

Must be explicitly marked as Client Components using "use client" directive.

COMPONENTS FIXED:
-----------------
1. src/components/ui/button.tsx - Added "use client"
2. src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx - Added "use client"
3. src/components/ui/dialog.tsx - Added "use client"
4. src/components/ui/tabs.tsx - Added "use client"
5. src/components/ui/select.tsx - Added "use client"
6. src/components/ui/accordion.tsx - Added "use client"
7. src/components/ui/label.tsx - Added "use client"
8. src/components/ui/progress.tsx - Added "use client"

VERIFICATION:
-------------
✓ Development server started successfully on http://localhost:3002
✓ No errors detected during compilation
✓ All Radix UI interactive components now properly marked as Client Components

STATUS: RESOLVED ✓
